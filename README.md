# Diabetic Retinopathy Retinal Image Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
Diabetic Retinopathy is a diabetes-related eye disease that can lead to vision loss if not detected early.  
This project focuses on analyzing retinal fundus images using machine learning / deep learning techniques to automatically detect signs of Diabetic Retinopathy.

The system processes retinal images, extracts features, and classifies the severity of the disease to assist in early diagnosis.
